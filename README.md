# üî¥SOC-GHTK
This is a Project Designed for Security Analysts at Giao Hang Tiet Kiem JSC (GHTK)

<ins> **NOTE - This is an Ongoing Project and the repo will be updated as we work on the new additions.** </ins>

This Projects serves below usecases:
 - **Collect Data** to a Single Place.
 - **Normalize** and **Parse Data**
 - **Visualize Data** and prepare meaningful Security Analytics
 - Create **Incidents/Cases** out of Security Alerts identified based on collected data/logs
 - **Automate** process of Threat Hunt, Creation of actionable Playbooks, SOC data Analytics
 - **Automate** the process of analsis observables they have collected, **at scale, by querying a single tool** instead of several
 - Actively respond to threats and interact with the constituency and other teams
 - Scan internal network regularly
 - **Enrich** Data feeds with Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform

	- Official GitRepo of Graylog is **[HERE](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar)**
 - **Graylogs**: [Graylog](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server) is built to open standards for connectivity and interoperability to seamlessly collect, transfer, store, and analyze log data. Graylog is also SIEM-agnostic by design‚Äîour log streams can pass unaltered or enriched data to any application in your monitoring, alerting, and analysis stack. Your choice of scalable log management solution should let you do more with your security and performance data.
    - Official GitRepo of Graylog is **[HERE](https://www.graylog.org/)**
 - **Fleetdm**: [fleetdm](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet) State of the art host monitoring platform tailored for security experts. Leveraging Facebook's battle-tested osquery project, Fleetdm delivers continuous updates, features and fast answers to big questions.
	- Official GitRepo of Fleetdm is **[HERE](https://fleetdm.com/)**
 - **Osquery**: [Osquery](https://osquery.io/) Easily ask questions about your Linux and macOS infrastructure using a SQL-like query language; the provided incident-response pack helps you detect and respond to breaches.
	- Official GitRepo of Fleetdm is **[HERE](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)**
 - **Sysmon**: [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time. By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents and subsequently analyzing them, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware operate on your network.
	- Official GitRepo of Sysmon is **[HERE](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)**
 - **Carbon Black** [Carbon Black](https://www.vmware.com/products/carbon-black-cloud-endpoint.html) VMware Carbon Black Endpoint consolidates multiple endpoint security capabilities using one agent and console, helping you operate faster and more effectively.
	- Official GitRepo of Carbon Black is **[HERE](https://github.com/carbonblack)**
 - **Suricata**: [Suricata](https://suricata.io/) is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF and the Suricata community.
	- Official GitRepo of Suricata is **[HERE](https://github.com/OISF/suricata)**
 - **Monitotring** we use TIG Stack stand for Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana, prometheus 
## Another open source we recommend with similar functionality
 - **TheHive**: [TheHive](https://thehive-project.org/) is a scalable 3-in-1 open source and free Security Incident Response Platform designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.
 - **Cortex**: Cortex, an open source and free software, has been created by TheHive Project for this very purpose. Observables, such as IP and email addresses, URLs, domain names, files or hashes, can be analyzed one by one or in bulk mode using a Web interface. Analysts can also automate these operations thanks to the Cortex REST API.
    - Official GitRepo of Cortex is **[HERE](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex)**
 - **MISP**: MISP is an open source software solution for collecting, storing, distributing and sharing cyber security indicators and threats about cyber security incidents analysis and malware analysis.
